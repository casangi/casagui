# Origin Story

This directory contains a small subset of the anaconda recipes developed by Peter Williams and collaborators. The files found beneath this directory have likely been modified or renamed. The originial files can be found (as of 12/16/2021) in [Peter's github repository](https://github.com/pkgw/conda-recipes).

We are grateful for Peter's past work enabling building of CASA with anaconda.

# CASA development

CASA 6 now mostly builds with packages currently available in anaconda. The exception is Qt 4 which is required for the legacy GUI components. This directory contains the recipes for building Qt 4.8.7 and Qwt 6.1.1. These build recipes are likely incomplete. They have only been used for building on macOS and will need to be modified for building on linux.
