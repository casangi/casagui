    <p> This is a placeholder for future evolution of the CASA GUI interface. It is possible
      that this could be a placeholder for a few top level interfaces. With functionality
      encapsulated in <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React components</a>. Another part of
      what makes this possible is that each of these <i>top level interfaces</i> are very
      lightweight with minimal code that is only loaded if it is used. It is this feature
      that also makes it possible to have development demos available as part of the
      environment.
