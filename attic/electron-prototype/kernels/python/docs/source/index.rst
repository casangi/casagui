CASA Visualization for Python
=============================

This is part of the :xref:`casa` project at the :xref:`nrao`.

This project is currently in a **pre-alpha** state, but its functionality is being built
out as the project builds out applications. The project is based upon
:xref:`electron` and :xref:`bokeh`. This combination will allow the project to provide data
visualization to Python command-line users, Jupyter Notebook users and a stand-alone
desktop visualization application using the same codebase in all cases. These
technologies and by assocation, this project represent a radical shift away from
traditional, GUI toolkit based development.
