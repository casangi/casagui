Visualization Applications
=============================

.. currentmodule:: applications

The CASA visualization development targets a number of :ref:`usage settings <design-system-design>`.
The goal is for a single codebase to have the flexibility to support users in a
number of very different settings. This is only possible due to powerful frameworks
like :xref:`electron` and :xref:`bokeh`.

This section will discuss the applications which drive the implementation of the :code:`casagui`
package. These applications provide a convenient way to access the functionality
that is included in CASA.
