Visualization Applications
=============================

.. currentmodule:: applications

The CASA visualization development targets a number of :ref:`usage settings <design-system-design>`.
The goal is for a single codebase to have the flexibility to support users in a
number of very different settings. This is only possible due to powerful frameworks
like :xref:`electron` and :xref:`bokeh`.

This section will discuss the applications which drive the implementation of the CASA
visualization system. These applications are important because they educate the team
of developers, probe the limits of what is possible in each of the usage settings and
provide an opportunity to engage with users.
