CASA Visualization Environment
==============================
This documentation describes the visualization environment that is being developed for :xref:`casa`.
This environment is very much a work in progress, and it should be consisdered *pre-alpha*. This is
an aggressive project that aims to support three separate use cases:

* Python users using a terminal with web browser based displays
* Jupyter Notebook users with display inline in the notebook
* Stand-alone application users

An *interactive clean* implementation is currently under development. This application is designed to
primarily support Python users and developers using a terminal to interact with Python.
