# Python Package for CASAGUI

This directory contains the _Python_ package implementation for `casagui`.
`casagui` is the visualization front end for the CASA package. The important
thing to understand is that this _Python_ package is designed to be used
in three very different contexts.

## End User

This group of users includes other CASA developers who use _Python_ as well
as _modular CASA_ users. These users will install this package
(often) using _PyPI_ and will import it like:
```
bash$ ipython
Python 3.8.10 (default, Jun 15 2021, 04:49:06) 
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 7.24.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: import casagui
```
In this usage mode, the visualization elements will appear as a tab in
the user's web browser.

## CASA Application

In the future there will be a CASA application built using Electron. This
application will be based upon `ipykernel` (the Jupyter Notebook kernel
for Python) and this application will import `casagui` to create the
key visualization elements (from _Python_) for display in the desktop,
Electron App.

## Notebook Users

The goal is that _Jupyter Notebook_ cells can import `casagui` and the
key visualization elements will appear, in place, in the notebook.

# Prototype Demo

The _image cube scrolling_ demo for the interactive clean prototype was moved
here to demonstrate the *current state* of image cube information flow
between the _Bokeh_ plot in the web browser (via `casagui`/`casaguijs`
extensions to _Bokeh_). This will change in the future (with this demo
probably moving to a `demo` directory), but for the time being, you
can run this demo by:

1. `cd` to this directory (`casagui/kernels/python`)
1. [build casaguijs](casaguijs/readme.md)
1. ensure that `casatools` and `bokeh` are available in your `python3` installation (or `PYTHONPATH`)
1. run `bash$ python3 image-data-source-demo.py`

Currently, you have to use `^C` to exit.


# Example of casagui.apps usage
## Plot antenna positions: `plotants`
In an interactive Python session, or from a Jupyter Notebook:
```python
from casagui.apps import plotants


plotants("ngc5921.ms") # this will prompt a Bokeh plot in web browser tab
plotants("ngc5921.ms", filename="fig_plotants_ngc5921.pdf") # this will produce a PDF image of the plot
```
