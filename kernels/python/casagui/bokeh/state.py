    The ``casaguijs`` extensions for Bokeh are built into a stand-alone
    external JavaScript file constructed for the specific version of
    Bokeh that is being used. The URL or the local path to a locally
    built verion must be supplied as the ``lib`` parameter. If ``lib``
    is ``None`` then the default is to use the published verison of
    ``casaguijs`` extensions built and installed for `HTTP` access.

    Parameters
    ----------
    libs: None or str or list of str
        javascript library to load could be a local path, a URL or None.
        None is the default in which case it loads the published library
        for the current version of ``casaguijs`` and ``bokeh``
    dev: int, optional
        Chrome caches the javascript files. This parameter allows for
        specifying `dev` allows for including a development version
        for incremental updates to JavaScript from website.
