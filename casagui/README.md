Visualization for the CASA package
==================================

This package includes the visualization elements of the CASA package for
processing data collected from radio telescopes. More information about CASA
can be found on the [CASA home page](https://casa.nrao.edu/).

casagui is based on [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/). It provides visualization
elements for three different interaction settings::

    * Python command line with display to a web browser
    * Jupyter notebook
    * [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app

However not all elements support all interaction settings.
